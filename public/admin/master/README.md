# rcmap - Realtime mapping of anonymous edits to Wikipedia

rcmap uses [d3.js](http://d3js.org) and
[DataMaps](http://datamaps.github.io) to display a world map showing
anonymous edits to Wikipedia, [geolocated by
IP](http://freegeoip.net). Data is served over WebSockets served by an
instance of [wikimon](https://github.com/hatnote/wikimon).
